How to Run Tests:

-> Run the test file as TestNG (Execute the test suite using TestNG, which can be run directly from an IDE)
-> Run with testng.xml file


Implementation Strategy:

To automate the test cases for given user storey, used Selenium WebDriver with Java as the Programming language, TestNG as a testing Framework and Listeners to generate Test report

1. Used Selenium WebDriver to simulate the user actions in Chrome 

2. Used PageObjectModel(POM) design pattern to create the structure object repository 

3. User Java Programming language to develop the logic that perform user actions on UI

4. Used Assertions to verify the results of each Test case

5. Use the built-in TestNG reporting feature to generate HTML or XML reports after test run

6. Implemented code in Eclipse editor and used Maven dependencies
